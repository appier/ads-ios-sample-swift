# Appier Ads iOS Swift Sample App

This is a sample app to demonstrate Appier Ads SDK and mediation to different networks.

## Install fastlane

Donâ€™t install fastlane globally. Instead, in each repository, run the following to install fastlane and the other Gem dependencies locally.

```
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
```

The code samples below assume an alias to `bundle exec fastlane` is set in the shell profile:

```
alias fastlane='bundle exec fastlane'
```
